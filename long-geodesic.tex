\section{Introduction}

The goal of this note is to introduce the reader to the theory of intrinsic geometry of convex surfaces and prove the following theorem.
This theorem is given as an illustration to the theory, not the other way around.

Recall that a curve in a convex surface is called geodesic if every sufficiently short arc of the curve is length minimizing
and we say that it is simple if it has no self intersections.

A tetrahedron with equal opposite edges is called \emph{isosceles}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
	\label{Long geodesic}
Assume that the surface $\Sigma$ of a convex body $B$ in the Euclidean space $\EE^3$
admits an arbitrary long simple closed geodesic.
Then $B$ is an isosceles tetrahedron.
\end{thm}

For the surfaces of convex polyhedrons, the statement was proved by Vladimir Protasov in \cite{protasov}.
 

\section{An overview of the theory}

The intrinsic metric on convex surfaces has certain comparison property, which we about to discuss.
A very short but comprehensive introduction to the subject was written by Alexander Alexandrov in \cite{alexandrov1941}.

By \emph{surface} we will understand a compact two-dimensional surface, possibly with boundary, which is equipped with geodesic metric.
That is, a metric space $\Sigma$ is a surface if it is homeomorphic to a two-dimesinoanl manifold 
and any two points $p,q\in \Sigma$ can be joined by a curve with length $|p-q|_\Sigma$;
we denote by $|p-q|_\Sigma$ the distance from $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$.
This curve will be denoted as $[pq]$ and called \emph{minimizing geodesic} from $p$ to $q$.

For a triple of points $x,y,z\in\Sigma$, a choice of a triple of geodesics $([x y], [y z], [z x])$ will be called a \index{triangle}\emph{triangle} 
and denoted as 
$[x y z]$.
Given a triple $x,y,z\in \Sigma$ there may be many different triangles with these vertices may exist, any of which can be denoted by $[x y z]$.

A triangle $[\~x\~y\~z]$ in the plane $\EE^2$
with the same side lengths as $[x y z]$ 
is called \emph{model triangle} of $[x y z]$;
this relation will be written as $[\~x\~y\~z]=\~\triangle(x y z)$.
The angle $\mangle\hinge{\~x}{\~y}{\~z}$ of the model triangle $[\~x\~y\~z]$ is called \emph{model angles} $[x y z]$ at $x$ and denoted as $\angk x y z$.

%???+PIC

Two geodesics $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ with common end $x$ is called \emph{hinge} and denoted as $\hinge{x}{y}{z}$.
The angle $\mangle\hinge{x}{y}{z}$ of the hinge is defined as the limit of model angles for small triangle sling along the sides of hinge to its vertex. Namely,
\[\mangle\hinge{x}{y}{z}=\lim_{\bar y,\bar z\to x}\set{\angk{x}{\bar y}{\bar z}}{ \bar y\in \left]xy\right], \bar z\in \left]xz\right]},\]
where $\left]xy\right]=[xy]\backslash\{x\}$.

Note that if $p\in \left]xy\right[=[xy]\backslash\{x,y\}$ then $\mangle\hinge{p}{x}{y}=\pi$.

\begin{thm}{Comparison property}\label{Comparison property}
We say that hinge $\hinge x y z$ 
satisfies \emph{comparison} if the angle
$\mangle\hinge{x}{y}{z}$ is defined and 
\[\mangle \hinge{x}{y}{z} \ge \angk{x}{x}{y}{}{}.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Supplementary angles property}\label{Supplementary angles property}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a surface where comparison property holds for any hinge.
Then for any triple of points $x,y,z\in \Sigma$ and $p\in \left]xy\right[$ we have
\[\mangle\hinge{p}{x}{z}+\mangle\hinge{p}{y}{z}=\pi,\]
here we assume that the two hinges $\hinge{p}{x}{z}$ and $\hinge{p}{y}{z}$ have a common side $[pz]$
\end{thm}

If in the surface $\Sigma$, the angles of all hinges are defined and satisfy 
the comparison and supplementary angles property, then we say that $\Sigma$
has \emph{nonnegative curvature in the sence of Alexandrov}.


The following two theorems play central role in the theory.
They admit generalizations to higher dimensions, but we need it only for surfaces.

\begin{thm}{Globalization theorem}\label{Globalization theorem}
Assume that any point the surface $\Sigma$ admits a neighborhood $U$ such that the angles of all hinges in $U$ are defined and satisfy 
the comparison and supplementary angles property.
Then $\Sigma$ has non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Comparison theorem}\label{Comparison theorem}
Any surface of convex body in $\EE^3$,
if equipped with the induced intrinsic metric, 
is a surface with non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
\end{thm}

In fact, the converse of this theorem also holds
if one extends the definition of \emph{surface} 
to the convex bodies which degenerate to 2-dimensional sets.
The surface of flat convex figure has to be defined as its doubling;
that is, two copies 
of the figure glued along the boundary --- you can imagine that you can walk on both sides of the figure but can not pass through it.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Any surface $\Sigma$ with non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov which is homeomorphic to the sphere
is isometric to the surface of convex body $K$ in $\EE^3$,
which possibly degenerate to a flat figure.
\end{thm}

It turns out that $\Sigma$ defines $K$ up to congruence.
This a hard theorem was proved by Pogorelov, see \cite{pogorelov}.
We will use the following weaker statement
it was proved earlier by Alexandrov in \cite{alexandrov1950}.
The proof goes essentially the same way as the Cauchy's rigidity theorem.

\begin{thm}{Rigidity theorem}\label{Rigidity theorem}
Convex polyhedrons in $\EE^3$ with isometric surfaces are congruent. 
\end{thm}

Let $\Sigma$ be a surface with non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
Assume a triangle $[xyz]$ bounds in $\Sigma$ an open set $\Delta$ homeomorphic to a disc which is convex.
That is any minimizing geodesic with ends in $\Delta$
lie completely in $\Delta$.
In this case we define the \emph{curvature} of $\Delta$ as the angle excess of $[xyz]$;
that is,
\[\kappa(\Delta)=\angk x y z+\angk  y z x+\angk z x y-\pi.\]
It extends to non-negative measure, so called \index{curvature measure}\emph{curvature measure} in the unique way, defined on all Borel subsets in the interior of $\Sigma$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{20 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/mercedes(1)}
%\lbl[r]{0,8;$p$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

It turns out that in $\Sigma$, any geodesic without its end-points has vanishing curvature;
this can be proved by covering interior of geodesic by triangles with small excess.

Further the curvature of an interior point in $\Sigma$ can be thought as $\pi$ minus total angle around it.
The later can be seen from the picture ---
to find the curvature of the central vertex one has to subtract curvature of three small triangles from the curvature of big one.

For curvature measure, an analog of Gauss--Bonnet formula holds;
in particular, if $\Sigma$ is a surface with non-negative curvature in the sence of Alexandrov then
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic to the sphere then 
\[\kappa(\Sigma)=4\cdot\pi\]
\item If a closed geodesic cuts from $\Sigma$ a disc $\Delta$ then 
\[\kappa(\Delta)=2\cdot\pi.\]
\end{itemize}

We also will use the following comparison,
it follows easily from the comparison.

\begin{thm}{Area comparison}\label{Area comparison}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a surface with non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov
and a triangle $[xyz]$ in $\Sigma$ bounds a open set $\Delta$ homeomorphic to a disc.
Then 
\[\area\Delta\ge \area\~\triangle(xyz).\]

\end{thm}

\section{Four singular points}

The following lemma is the key to the proof of Theorem~\ref{Long geodesic}.

\begin{thm}{Lemma} 
Assume that the surface $\Sigma$ of a convex body $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$
admits an arbitrary long simple closed geodesic.
Then the surface of $B$ contains $4$ singular points with curvature $\pi$ and the rest of it is flat.
\end{thm}

For the proof we will show that for any $\varepsilon$ is is possible to found four non-intersecting open sets of diameter $\varepsilon$, such that each of them having curvature at least $\pi - \varepsilon$.
Going to the limit we will get the statement of the Lemma.

By cutting the surface $\Sigma$ along a sufficiently long closed simple geodesic,
we get two discs.
The key step is to show that each of these discs is long and thin.
Then we show that their ``corners'' form four required sets with big curvature.

To be more precise the founded four sets will have small perimeter.
The following claim implies that these conditions are equivalent.
In fact, this claim holds for any metric on the sphere, not necessary closed convex surface.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{Lemma:diameter-perimeter}
For any $\varepsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$, that any simple curve in $\Sigma$ of length smaller than $\delta$ bounds a region of diameter at most $\varepsilon$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Arguing by contradiction, suppose there is a sequence of curves $\gamma_n$ withs $\length\gamma_n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ such that each $\gamma_n$ cuts sphere into open regions $A_n$ and $B_n$ of diameter at least $\varepsilon$. 
By compactness of $\Sigma$,
we can pass to a subsequence of $\gamma_n$ which converges to a point, say $p$. 

Note that for large $n$, each region contains a disk with centers $a_n$ and $b_n$ and radius $\tfrac\varepsilon3$ from $p$. 
Indeed, if $n$ is large, then $\gamma_n$ lies in $\tfrac\eps3$ neighborhood of $p$.
Since the diameter of regions is at least $\eps$, points in the regions maximizing the distance to $p$ will do the trick.

Pass to a subsequence of $\gamma_n$ so that $a_n$ and $b_n$ converge, denote by $a$ and $b$ their limits.
Note that for large $n$ the domains $A_n$ and $B_n$ contain the disks of radius $\tfrac\varepsilon4$ centered at $a$ and $b$ correspondingly.
In particular, for all large $n$, any path from $a$ to $b$ have to pass through $\gamma_n$.
Since $\gamma_n$ converges to $p$, any path from $a$ to $b$ pass through $p$.
The later does not hold since $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic to the sphere, a contradiction.

\parit{Proof.}
Cut the surface $\Sigma$ along a sufficiently long closed simple geodesic,
we get two discs.
Choose one of the discs, say $D$;
equip it with the intrinsic metric further denoted by $|{*}-{*}|_D$.


According to the comparison theorem (\ref{Comparison theorem}) the surface $\Sigma$ has non-negative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
By globalization theorem (\ref{Globalization theorem})
the same holds for $D$.

Choose a pair of points $p,q\in\partial D$ which maximize the distance $|p-q|_D$.
Clearly,
\[|x-p|_D,|x-q|_D\le |p-q|_D\] 
for any other point $x\in\partial D$.
By comparison property (\ref{Comparison property}) 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pxq>pi/3}
	\measuredangle[x\,^p_q]\ge \tfrac\pi3.\tag{${*}$}
\end{equation}




\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{28 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/long-geodesic-diam(1)}
\lbl[r]{0,8;$p$}
\lbl[l]{28,8;$q$}
\lbl[b]{10,16;$\gamma_1(t)$}
\lbl[l]{12,9,-60;$\ge\tfrac\pi3$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

The points $p$ and $q$ divide $\partial D$ into two arcs,
say $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$;
let us parametrize them by arclength from $p$ to $q$. 
Note that 
\[\tfrac{d}{dt}|p-\gamma_i(t)|_D=-\cos \phi,\] 
where $\phi$ is the angle between the direction of $\gamma_i$ at $x=\gamma_i(t)$ and the geodesic $[xp]$;
the same way 
\[\tfrac{d}{dt}|q-\gamma_i(t)|_D=-\cos \psi,\] 
where $\psi$ is the angle between the direction of $\gamma_i$ at $x=\gamma_i(t)$ and the geodesic $[xq]$.
By \eqref{eq:pxq>pi/3} and the supplementary angles property (\ref{Supplementary angles property}) we have $\phi-\psi\ge \tfrac\pi3$.
Therefore 
\begin{equation}
\tfrac{d}{dt}\left(|p-\gamma_i(t)|_D-|q-\gamma_i(t)|_D\right)
= \cos \psi-\cos\phi
\ge
\tfrac12.
\tag{${*}{*}$}
\end{equation}

In particular
\[|p-q|_D\ge \tfrac18{\cdot}\length[\partial D].\]
That is, if the geodesic was long 
then $D$ has large diameter.

Fix small $\delta$ with respect to $\varepsilon$. 
(The value $\delta=\varepsilon\cdot\sin \varepsilon$ will do.
It means that any euclidean triangle with one side equal $\varepsilon$ and one side equals $\delta$ has an angle opposite to the side $\delta$ less than $\varepsilon$).

Let $x$ and $y$ be the first points along $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ at distance $\varepsilon$ from $p$.
If $|q-x|_D>|q-y|_D$, move the point $y$ along $\gamma_2$ toward $p$ until $|q-x|_D=|q-y|_D$; 
since $|p-q|_D$ is maximal, this distance will be achieved. 
In case $|q-x|_D<|q-y|_D$ do the same with the point $x$. 
Note that now $|q-x|_D=|q-y|_D\ge|p-q|_D-\varepsilon$.

By the area comparison (\ref{Area comparison})
\[\area \tilde \triangle qxy\le \area \triangle qxy\le \area \Sigma.\]
It follows that 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:|x-y|}
\begin{aligned}
|x-y|_D&\le2\cdot\frac{ \area[\tilde\triangle(xyq)]}{|q-x|_D}
\le 
100\cdot\frac{ \area\Sigma}{\length[\partial D]}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{${*}{*}{*}$}
\end{equation}
Therefore, if $D$ has sufficiently large perimeter then $|x-y|_D <\delta$.

\end{lpic}
\end{center}

Cut from $D$ along a minimizing geodesic $[xy]$
and consider part (a lune) $L_p$ with the point $p$ in it.
Note that the curvature of $L_p$ is $\alpha+\beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ the angles as on the diagram.
By comparison $\alpha\ge \tilde\measuredangle(x\,^p_y)$ 
and $\beta\ge \tilde\measuredangle(y\,^p_x)$.
Therefore curvature of $L_p$ is at least $\pi-\tilde\measuredangle(p\,^x_y)>\pi-\varepsilon$.
% In particular, if $|x-y|_D$ much less then $|p-x|_D+|p-y|_D$ then the curvature of $L_p$ is almost $\pi$.


Fix $\varepsilon>0$.
Assuming $\length[\partial D]$ is long enough, we can find a lune $L_p$ with perimeter at most $2\cdot\eps + \delta$,
such that curvature $L_p$ is at least $\pi-\eps$.
If $\eps$ is small, by Lemma \ref{Lemma:diameter-perimeter}, $L_p$ has small diameter.

Using the same construction for $p$ and $q$ in the disc $D$,
and for the other disc,
we get four lunes in $\Sigma$, 
each of diameter at most $\eps$, 
and each with curvature at least $\pi-\eps$.
By Gauss--Bonnet formula, the remaining curvature is at most $4\cdot\eps$.

Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, the curvature measure has $4$ atomic points with curvature $\pi$ each and the remaining part of $\Sigma$ is flat.
\qeds


%Let us go to the limit and show that there are four distinct singular points of curvature $\pi/2$ each.
%%Choose a sequence of quadruples $\{L_n^1, L_n^2, L_n^3, L_n^4\}$ of loons constructed by above descirbed way, which diameters tend to zero, and points $a_n^i\in L_n^i$. 
%By compactness of $\Sigma$ there is a subsequence of quadruples that $a^i_n \to a^i$, for $i=1,..,4$.

%First, note that $a^1$ has curvature at least $\pi/2$. Indeed, any open neighborhood contains $L_n^1$ for sufficiently big $n$, therefore curvature of any open sets containing $a^1$ is at least $\pi/2$.
%%On the other hand for sufficiently big $n$ there is a neighborhood of $a^1$ not containing $L_n^i$, $i=2,3,4$.
%Indeed, if it not the case, then curvature at point $a^1$ will be at least $\pi$, which is not possible for convex bodies.
%We also note that for sufficiently large $n$ (when $\varepsilon<\pi/4$) the point $a^1$ should belongs to some of the lune $L_n^i$, because in other case the total curvature of $\Sigma$ will be greater than $4\pi$, which contradicts the Gauss--Bonnet theorem.
%Therefore it could belong only to $L_n^1$.
%The same arguments work for points $a^i$, $i=2,3,4$, and these points are different because they belong to a different $L_n^i$.

\section{Isosceles tetrahedron}

\begin{thm}{Lemma} 
Assume that the closed convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$
has $4$ singular points with curvature $\pi$.
Then it bounds an isosceles tetrahedron.
\end{thm}

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{21 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-4 mm),b(-3 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/akopyan(1)}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote the singular points by $p$, $x$, $y$ and $z$.

Let us cut $\Sigma$ along three geodesics $[px]$, $[py]$ and $[pz]$.
Develop the obtained flat surface on the plane.
Note that as the result we obtain a triangle $\triangle$; 
the points $x$, $y$ and $z$ correspond to the midpoints of the sides of $\triangle$
and the point $p$ correspond to the vertices of $\triangle$.

}

It follows that $\Sigma$ is isometric to the surface of isosceles tetrahedron.
The statement now follows from the Pogorelov's uniqueness theorem,
mentioned in the theory overview.

Alternatively one could apply the following exercise and the rigidity theorem (\ref{Rigidity theorem}) which has much simple proof.
